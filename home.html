        <div class="service">
          <h3>Automatic Irrigation System</h3>
          <p>
            Our automatic irrigation system leverages a precise water level sensor that continuously monitors your water reservoir. Once the tank is detected to be full, the system seamlessly allows water to enter, ensuring a consistent supply. This intelligent process minimizes manual oversight and prevents overflow, guaranteeing efficient and reliable irrigation for your crops.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="service">
          <h3>Soil Moisture Monitoring</h3>
          <p>
            With our advanced soil moisture monitoring solution, sensors are embedded in the field to measure the moisture content in real time. When the soil begins to dry, the system promptly activates the irrigation process to draw water from the tank. This dynamic approach not only conserves water but also fosters optimal hydration, ensuring your plants thrive with the ideal moisture balance.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="service">
          <h3>Greenhouse Rain Protection</h3>
          <p>
            To protect your crops from unpredictable weather, our greenhouse is equipped with a state-of-the-art rain sensor. As soon as rain is detected, the system automatically closes the greenhouse, preventing excess water from entering and damaging your valuable plants. This proactive measure maintains a stable environment and safeguards your investment during inclement weather.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="service">
          <h3>Climate Monitoring</h3>
          <p>
            Utilizing the DHT11 sensor, our climate monitoring system continuously tracks ambient temperature and humidity. By integrating this climatic data with soil moisture readings, the system makes precise decisions on when to dispense water. This ensures that your crops receive just the right amount of hydration based on both weather conditions and soil needs, optimizing growth and reducing waste.
